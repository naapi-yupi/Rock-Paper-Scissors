# Rock-Paper-Scissors

Welcome to my new game: Rock-Paper-Scissors!

If you don't know the rules of the game, you may head to this link: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_paper_scissors

The player will be battling against a computer.

The game consists of 5 turns, so be sure to win all those rounds.
